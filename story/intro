        Long ago in the ancient land of Fienlandia, 
        a young lad slept soundly in his bed of straw.
        'Twas not a straw bed, mind you, but a simple
        pile of straw. For this lad was not one of
        those lucky boys whose parents could afford
        nice things like straw beds. Well, to be
        honest, the boy did not know if his parents 
        could afford nice things, because this boy 
        had never known his parents.

        But we are getting off topic. This young 
        lad was a thief by trade. He wondered from
        to town stealing whatever he could get his 
        hands on: watches, apples, shoes, and even
        the occasional nap in a stable like this one.

        *bang!* 
        *stomp stomp*

        What is that noise?

        Oh no! Hey! Wake up, lad! 
        The stable master is coming!
